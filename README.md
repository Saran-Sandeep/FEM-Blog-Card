### What I learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of responsive design and CSS layout techniques. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Flexbox for Layouts**  
   I used Flexbox to create a responsive layout for the blog card. This allowed me to center elements both horizontally and vertically:

   ```
   body {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: center;
       align-items: center;
       height: 100vh;
   }
   ```

2. **CSS Custom Properties**  
   I implemented CSS variables for colors, font sizes, and spacing, making the code more maintainable:

   ```
   :root {
       --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
       --gray-500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
       --spacing-300: 24px;
   }
   ```

3. **BEM Naming Convention**  
   Following the BEM methodology helped me organize my CSS classes effectively:

   ```
   <div class="blog-card__author">
       <img src="/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Greg Hooper's avatar" class="blog-card__author-avatar" />
       <p class="blog-card__author-name">Greg Hooper</p>
   </div>
   ```

4. **Responsive Design**  
   I used media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes:
   ```
   @media (min-width: 1440px) {
       .blog-card {
           width: 384px;
           height: auto;
       }
   }
   ```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

1. Improving accessibility by adding ARIA roles and testing with screen readers.
2. Using CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
3. Enhancing hover and focus states for better interactivity.
4. Exploring advanced responsive techniques like `clamp()` for fluid typography.
